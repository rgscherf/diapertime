# Diapertime 

## A painless way to track baby IO.

Recording your newborn's feeds and diaper changes is an essential part of new parenting. It's also a pain in the neck. Let's make it easy.

With Diapertime, you can: 

- Enter a new feed from your phone. It's quick--you don't have time to be doing any of this.
- View all past feeds in a sortable table.
- Filter feeds. Just want to see times the baby pooped? How about time the baby slept > 2 hours?
- (Eventually) visualize trends. How long is your baby's average sleep? Is feed volume trending upward?

## Tech notes

Diapertime is built on a combination of Flask, Linux, Elm, and MongoDB. It's the FLEM stack!
