# Diaper Time

Diaper Time represents each period of your baby's wakefulness as one event. Enter the important information for that event and instantly see how it compares to historical data.

I built Diaper Time because nothing else provided a quick, elegant way to track my baby's I/O.

# TODO

## Features - Quick

- Save new user events to db
- Button to toggle percentile info
- New event feed defaults to avg of last X feeds

## Features - Not Quick

- Random baby name for /random
- Stretch: feed unit? (ml | oz | minutes)

## Bugs
- Is summary info calculating start/end bounds correctly?
  - May not be taking time zone into account
